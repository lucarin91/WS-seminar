# HTTP Authentication Framework
Original standardization document **rfc2617** ("HTTP Authentication: Basic and Digest Access Authentication") from IETF(Internet Engineering Task Force) and than updated with:
- rfc7617 "The 'Basic' HTTP Authentication Scheme"
- rfc7616 "HTTP Digest Access Authentication"
- rfc6750 "The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework: Bearer Token Usage"


# Basic Authentication
A simple authentication system, in with the client send `user-id:password` encoded in Base64 in the `Authentication` header field

for example for user-id "Aladdin" and password "open sesame":
```
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==
```

note:
To receive authorization, the client:

1.  obtains the user-id and password from the user,

2.  constructs the user-pass by concatenating the user-id, a single
    colon (":") character, and the password,

3.  encodes the user-pass into an octet sequence (see below for a
    discussion of character encoding schemes),

4.  and obtains the basic-credentials by encoding this octet sequence
    using Base64 ([RFC4648], Section 4) into a sequence of US-ASCII
    characters ([RFC0020]).


## Digest Authentication
It's a challenge responce system, here the username and the password it's never trasmit in clear text.

The server send a random `nonce` and the client have to reply with `hash(user:password:nonce)`

note:
TO-ADD:
- two type session and non-session version
- the other required header keys


## Bearer Token
A security token with the property that any party in possession of
the token (a "bearer") can use the token in any way that any other
party in possession of it can.  Using a bearer token does not
require a bearer to prove possession of cryptographic key material
(proof-of-possession).

```
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
Authorization: Bearer mF_9.B5f-4.1JqM
```



# From stateless to statefull
we want to avoid to communicate at every request username and password.

we need a way to authenticate a client throw a set of consecutively request.

we want to save same data for every single user

note:
HTML is a stateless protocol, but usually application needs to keep information between two distinct calls.



# HTTP Web Session
with HTTP/1.1 and CGI there is the possibility to implement a statefull server

the we server can manage the session and retrieve it by a sessionID.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP_session
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface

note:
is important that the sessionID is:
- higlly random, to avoid prediction
- sufficient long, to avoid brute force attack (>= 50 character)


## How thous work
![session-flow](img/session_flow.jpg)

note:
it use cookies to store sessionID on the client, than at each connection retrieve it from an hashtable inside the webserver.

http://machinesaredigging.com/2013/10/29/how-does-a-web-session-work/


## PHP example
```php
<?php
session_start();
if (!isset($_SESSION['count'])) {
  $_SESSION['count'] = 0;
} else {
  $_SESSION['count']++;
}
?>
```

note:
http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.session.php


## security issue
- Hijacking, by observation, brute force or XSS.
- CSRF, because it rely on cookies

note:
CSRF: the site can be put in <iframe>, generate a POST request and re-use the existing authentication cookie to another request.

# Tokens
It is an object contained the security credential to a login session

It can be:
- self-contained token
- opaque token

note:
- self-contained token, These are tokens that conform to the JSON Web Token standard and contain information about an identity in the form of claims. They are self-contained in that it is not necessary for the recipient to call a server to validate the token.

- Opaque tokens, Opaque tokens are tokens in a proprietary format that typically contain some identifier to information in a serverâ€™s persistent storage. To validate an opaque token, the recipient of the token needs to call the server that issued the token.



## JWT
*rfc7519* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519
```
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
{
    "iss": "lucar.in"
    "exp": 1469268709, // Sat Jul 23 12:09:50 CEST 2016
    "name": "luca",
    "admin": true,
}
```

after encoded

.
5Z5tKUacfE-r_L56uaddeimgREpgk39Fbx6EJ3cuTJg
```


## Registered Claims
- iss: The issuer of the token
- sub: The subject of the token
- aud: The audience of the token
- exp: Token expiration time defined in Unix time
- nbf: "Not before" time that identifies the time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing
- iat: "Issued at" time, in Unix time, at which the token was issued
- jti: JWT ID claim provides a unique identifier for the JWT


## Insecure implementation

## OAuth
**rfc6749** https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749

It enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service in behalf of a resource owner.


## Roles
- resource owner (the end-user)
- client (the third-part application)
- resource server and authorization server (the service with the resource)

note:
- resource owner, An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.

- resource server, The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

- client, An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).

- authorization server, The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully     authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.


## Flow of authentication
<pre>
            +--------+                               +---------------+
            |        |--(A)- Authorization Request ->|   Resource    |
            |        |                               |     Owner     |
            |        |<-(B)-- Authorization Grant ---|               |
            |        |                               +---------------+
            |        |
            |        |                               +---------------+
            |        |--(C)-- Authorization Grant -->| Authorization |
            | Client |                               |     Server    |
            |        |<-(D)----- Access Token -------|               |
            |        |                               +---------------+
            |        |
            |        |                               +---------------+
            |        |--(E)----- Access Token ------>|    Resource   |
            |        |                               |     Server    |
            |        |<-(F)--- Protected Resource ---|               |
            +--------+                               +---------------+
</pre>

note:
- (A) The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization server as an intermediary.
- (B) The client receives an authorization grant, which is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization, expressed using one of four grant types defined in this specification or using an extension grant type. The authorization grant type depends on the method used by the client to request authorization and the types supported by the authorization server.
- (C) The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.
- (D) The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.
- (E) The client requests the protected resource from the resource server and authenticates by presenting the access token.
- (F) The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.


## Obtaining Authentication
OAuth defines four grant types:

- authorization code, The authorization code grant type is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for **confidential clients**.

- implicit, The implicit grant type is used to obtain access tokens (it does not support the issuance of refresh tokens) and is optimized for **public clients** known to operate a particular redirection URI.

- resource owner password credentials, The resource owner password credentials grant type is suitable in cases where the **resource owner has a trust relationship with the client**, such as the device operating system or a highly privileged application.

- client credentials, The client can request an access token using only its client credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).



## OpenID
**OpenID Connect 1.0** (http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)

An identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server.

            |        |<--------(3) AuthN Response--------|        |
            |        |                                   |        |
            |        |---------(4) UserInfo Request----->|        |
            |        |                                   |        |
            |        |<--------(5) UserInfo Response-----|        |
            |        |                                   |        |
            +--------+                                   +--------+
</pre>

note:
1. The RP (Client) sends a request to the OpenID Provider (OP).
1. The OP authenticates the End-User and obtains authorization.
1. The OP responds with an ID Token and usually an Access Token.
1. The RP can send a request with the Access Token to the UserInfo Endpoint.
1. The UserInfo Endpoint returns Claims about the End-User.



## security issue
- XSS, it's possible to steal saved token with XSS (we can't use `HttpOnly`)
- the token can contain sensible information



# Session vs Token
Token are:
- scalable
- efficient (memory and computational)
- CSRF immune
- Cross Domain and CORS

Session are:
- centralized control
- XSS immune with `httpOnly` cookies
- less data send to each request



# Conclusion
If correcttly implemented either the two system have the same security
streanth.

One or the other depence of the gool of the project, but the token implementation is more general and 'pronta' for mobile and modern web app application.
